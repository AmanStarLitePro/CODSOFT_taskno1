Importing Libraries used in this project

Using pandas from pandas Library 
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from scipy.sparse import hstack
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

Step-1 : Loading Data from Churn_Modelling.csv in pandas DataFrame

Step-2 : Create a LabelEncoder object and Fit the encoder on your text labels and transform them to integers for both training and testing datasets

Step-3 : Appointing Features and Target for Training Dataset and Testing Dataset

Step-4 : Convert Y_train and Y_test values as integers as datatype of the Y value is in object form as declared in shape

Step-5 : Comparing and Training Logistic Regression, SVC and MultinomialNB models and Prediction on training data and testing data and finding accuracy
